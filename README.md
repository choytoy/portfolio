I have assembled a collection of my personal projets here for my application to Concordia's Computation Arts program.
This website has been stripped of much private information (including personal email), as github requires directories to be public for pages.

Respectfully, please refrain from contacting me unless you are the intended audience for this webpage (ie. Concordia University).
